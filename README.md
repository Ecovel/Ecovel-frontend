Approximately 8% of global carbon emissions come from tourism. However, most people have no way of knowing how much carbon they emit while traveling.To address this issue, we have planned an eco-friendly travel recommendation platform called **Ecovel**.

While previous services were merely about providing information, Ecovel focuses on actively encouraging user participation.
